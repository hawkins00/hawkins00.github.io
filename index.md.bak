# Hi, I'm Hawkins

I'm a software engineer looking for a challenging dev position.

I will be available October 2019, but feel free to [contact me](mailto:hello@hawkins.dev) sooner. I'm currently thru-hiking the 2,650-mile [Pacific Crest Trail](https://www.pcta.org/discover-the-trail/ "Discover the PCT") with my wife, Joy.
